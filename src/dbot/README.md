# Depth Based Object Tracking Library (dbot)

This library implements two different object tracking algorithms:
 * A Particle Filter based Tracker (https://am.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/publications/wuthrich_iicirs_2013)
   
   This tracker can run on a pure CPU system or optionally run on GPU using CUDA 6.5 or later

All trackers require mesh models of the tracked objects in Wavefront (.obj) format. 
To get started, we recommend that you follow the instructions at https://github.com/bayesian-object-tracking/getting_started.

# Requirements
 * Ubuntu 14.04
 * C++11 Compiler (gcc-4.7 or later)
 * [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) 6.5 or later (optional)
 
## Dependecies
 * [Filtering library](https://github.com/filtering-library/fl) (fl)
 * [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) 3.2.1 or later
 
# Compiling
 The cmake package uses [Catkin](https://github.com/ros/catkin). If you have installed ROS groovy or later, then you most likely have catkin installed already.

     $ cd $HOME
     $ mkdir -p projects/tracking/src  
     $ cd projects/tracking/src
     $ git clone git@github.com:filtering-library/fl.git
     $ git clone git@github.com:bayesian-object-tracking/dbot.git
     $ cd ..
     $ catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DDBOT_BUILD_GPU=On

If no CUDA enabled device is available, you can deactivate the GPU implementation via 

     $ catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DDBOT_BUILD_GPU=Off


# How to use dbot

Checkout the ros nodes of each tracker in [dbot_ros](https://github.com/bayesian-object-tracking/dbot_ros) package for exact usage of the filters.
