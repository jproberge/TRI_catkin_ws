/**
 * \brief This class provides a parallel implementation of the weighting step on
 *        the GPU.
 *
 * Some functions have to be called in a particular order:
 * init -> allocate_memory_for_max_poses -> set_number_of_poses       }
 *                                       -> set_occlusion_indices     } ->
 * weigh_poses
 *                                       -> set_observations          }
 * map_texture_to_texture_array    ---------------------------------  }
 *
 * allocate_memory_for_max_poses -> set_occlusion_probabilities
 *                               -> get_occlusion_probabilities
 *
 * Make sure to
 *  always render the poses first with opengl, then map the texture into CUDA,
 *  update the observation image with set_observations() and update the
 * occlusion indices (after resampling)
 *  before you call the weigh_poses() function.
