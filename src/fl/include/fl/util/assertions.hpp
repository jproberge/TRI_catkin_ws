/**
 * \ingroup macros
 * \internal
 *
 * This variadic macro performs a compile time derivation assertion. The first
 * argument is the derived type which is being tested whether it implements a
 * base type. The base type is given as the second argument list.
 *
 * __VA_ARGS__ was used as a second parameter to enable passing template
 * specialization to the macro.
 *
 * Note: The macro requires <em>derived_type</em> to be a single worded type. In
 *       case of a template specialization, use a typedef.
